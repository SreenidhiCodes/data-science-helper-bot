#  Data Science Helper Bot

A simple rule-based chatbot built in Python that answers beginner-friendly questions about datasets, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and predictive modeling tools.
This project demonstrates the use of if–elif–else logic, keyword detection, and loop-based interactions in Python.

# Objective
-Build a chatbot using rule-based logic.
-Respond to user queries based on predefined conditions.
-Simulate a conversational assistant for data science learners.
-Understand the basic NLP structure without using AI/ML models.

# Tools & Technologies
-Python 3.x
-Built-in functions (input, print, lower, strip)
-Conditional Statements (if–elif–else)
-While loops for continuous conversation

# Example Conversation
 Hello! I am your Data Science Helper Bot.
Ask me about datasets, EDA, predictive modeling, or other data science topics.
Type 'bye' to exit.
You: hi
Bot: Hi there! Ready to explore the world of data?
You: tell me about eda
Bot:  EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) Tools:
- Pandas & NumPy (Data manipulation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualizations)
- Pandas Profiling / ydata-profiling (Automated EDA reports)
- Sweetviz (Quick HTML insights)
- DTale (Interactive data browsing)
You: thank you
Bot: You're welcome!  Glad I could help.
You: bye
Bot: Goodbye! Happy coding!
